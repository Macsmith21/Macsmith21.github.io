                            <h3>Call of Duty Black Ops II</h3>
                            <p>Call of Duty is an iconic First person shooter series that is extremely well known and COD Black Ops 2 is easily my favorite entry. I put countless hours into this game when I was young and some of my best memories are playing the Zombies gamemode with my friends and completeing all the various quests for every map.</p>

                        <h3>Super Mario Galaxy</h3>
                        <p>Super Mario Galaxy is a 3D Mario platformer and while it was not my first of the genre, it is my favorite. The unique level designs and art style are so memorable and the music is amazing. I loved playing this game as a kid and continually go back to play a level or two when I feel compelled.</p>

                        <h3>Terraria</h3>
                        <p>Terraria is a 2D survival crafting game that is highly reminiscent of Minecraft but adds so much to the experience. The pixel art and soundtrack are extremely well produced and the unique bosses, items, and world building make it so fun and easy to sink your time into.</p>

                        <h3>Halo 3</h3>
                        <p>Halo 3 was my first introduction to the microsoft FPS series and is so memorable. Playing forge and custom games with my brothers and friends as well as coming to know the Master Chief through that campaign are a huge part of the reason I became an xbox fan and still play Halo today</p>

                        <h3>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</h3>
                        <p>Skyrim is one of the most renouned open world fantasy games. Dragons, magic, guilds, and a story where you are the chosen one. I loved skyrim my first time playing it and it really made me appreciate single player games like it so much more.</p>

                            <p>The Xbox 360 is the console my brothers and I got when I was about 8 years old and it made gaming a huge hobby of mine. Xbox 360 introduced me to online gaming and so many game series that I am so nostalgic about today.</p>

                        <h3>Nintendo Switch</h3>
                        <p>The Switch is such a fun console as it merges the handheld and big screen gaming experiences. With classic Nintendo Titles like Zelda and Mario being able to be played anywhere I enjoy the innovation of this console every time I travel</p>

                        <h3>Nintendo Ds Lite</h3>
                        <p>My first ever gaming console was actually a gameboy advance, but the DS allowed you to play any gameboy game on top of all the new Nintendo games releasing. I played so many games like Pokemon and Mario on my DS and I still have mine from when I was a kid.</p>

                        <h3>PlayStation 2</h3>
                        <p>I never owned a PS2 but many of my friends did and it was my introduction to console gaming. While I had a gamecube that I made many good memories on, there were so many games on the PS2 I couldnt play on my Gamecube and I always looked forward to being able to go to my friends house and play these games.</p>

                        <h3>Nintendo Wii</h3>
                        <p>The Wii was the one console that everyone had. I played so many games on the Wii with my entire family and all my friends. The motion controls were such a new experience and Nintnendo did a great job designing games around it.</p>
