                        <h2>Food</h2>
                        <p>There is so much food that has become "pop culture". Many of these are more so staples of cultural cuisines but there is also more representation than that, while Chicken Tikka Masala is the most popular indian dish and the Cheeseburger is an American staple, single dishes have also been associated with so characters, shows, and places. Some examples could include Homer Simpson and the Donut or the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Pizza. Food is a huge aspect of all culture it only makes sense that it takes its own light in pop culture as well. there are other parts of food that have been considered "pop culture" as well like starbucks as the stereotypical coffee shop all girls go to or certain fads/lifestyles like the "gymbro diet" circulating around beef, rice, and protein shakes.</p>
