                        <h3>Random Access Memories</h3>
                        <p>Random Access Memories By Daft Punk is an electronically produced album that cannot be defined in a single genre. Released in 2013 as the French duos final album, RAM featured a variety of renound artists and earned itslef 5 Grammy Awards in 2014. I have trouble picking favorites off of this album as I appreciate every track, yet I find myself always returning to the Giorgio By Moroder for its amazing drums.</p>

                        <h3>The Getaway</h3>
                        <p>The Getaway by The Red Hot Chili Peppers is their 2016 press and a difficult pick as my favorite album of theirs. I feel as though I resonate with this album mainly because I grew up being a huge fan of the band and was a teenager when the album released. Therefore, I was extremely hyped and gave it many listens. even though John Frusciante isn't the guitarist on the album, I still find myself enjoying the Guitar as much as I do on other albums</p>

                        <h2>History of the culture</h2>
                        <p>Music has long been a cornerstone of pop culture, evolving from ancient rituals to a global phenomenon. From classical compositions to the rock and roll rebellion of the 1950s, music has continuously shaped and reflected societal trends. The 20th century witnessed the rise of various genres like jazz, punk, hip-hop, and EDM, each leaving a distinct mark on popular culture. Advancements in technology have revolutionized music production and distribution, making it more accessible worldwide. Music has also been a powerful medium for social and political commentary, driving movements and inspiring change. Today, it remains a dynamic force, continually evolving and influencing the cultural landscape.</p>

                                <p>The 80s was a pivotal time for music. The Rise of rock bands like Motley Crue and Guns N Roses altered the landscape of rock music and the introduction of the synth into music created huge ripples with large changes in pop, disco, and dance music. Also during this time we saw the first remnants of hip hop music with groups like Run DMC. My favorite from this decade The Beastie Boys because my dad would play them all the time!</p>

                                <p>The 2000s was yet another big change for the constantly evolving medium. With new genres and fusions such as R&B, Emo Rock, and EDM, Music around this time left a lasting impact. Artists like Kanye West, Justin Timberlake, Beyonce, Usher, and Coldplay dominated the radiowaves and influenced almost every part of pop culture. Many of my favorite Artists came to be prominence the 2000s including Daft Punk, The Strokes, and Kanye West</p>

                                <h2>90s</h2>
                                <p>The 90s was a modern renaissance for genres like rock, Hip Hop, and Dance. Grunge, alternative, and shoegaze subgenres came to mainstream during this time and influenced much of what came after. Hip Hop also went through somewhat of a golden age during this time with artists like Biggie, Nas, and Dr. Dre revolutionizing the sound. Furthermore, Dance and House music was metamorphasizing as DJs learned to use electronic instruments to create their own Sounds. My personal favorites from this era are Radiohead, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Pearl Jam.</p>

                                <h2>10s</h2>
                                <p>The 2010s became a true culmination of all that came before. The introduction of streaming music allowed people to find their own niche sounds and artists to reach any audience. Ruling genres like Hip-Hop, Pop, Alternative, and EDM continued to reign and be built upon. Artists like Calvin Harris, Kendrick Lamar, Drake, The Weekend, Bruno Mars, Taylor Swift, and so many more were able to become bigger than anyone before them and music became an ever more complex medium. As this is the era that I lived most of my life in it is hard to pick favorites but I really enjoy many of the EDM, Indie, and Hip-Hop artists of this era.</p>
