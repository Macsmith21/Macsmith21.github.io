    <h1>Bill Nye the Science Guy!</h1>
    <strong>By Mac Smith</strong>
    <p>Bill Nye is the number one science guy. Bill is a popular science influencer who has his own science show oriented for children. As a child, I watched a multitude of Bill's films in my science courses. To this day I am a huge Bill Nye Fan</p>
    <p>Bill! Bill! Bill! Bill! Bill Nye the Science Guy!
    </p>

    </ul>
    <p>Bill is an educator of all things science encompasses. He has taught me about intersting topics such as the solar system and the atmosphere! I appreciate how Bill always makes things interesting to learn about; he is always goofy during his episodes and includes little experiments. I attribute much of my science knowledge to Bill Nye The Science Guy!</p>
