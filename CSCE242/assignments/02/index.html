Litter box is life i like big cats and i can not lie so eat the fat cats food and demand to have some of whatever the human is cooking, then sniff the offering and walk away poop in a handbag look delicious and drink the soapy mopping up water then puke giant foamy fur-balls. Roll on the floor purring your whiskers off. Stuff and things bawl under human beds. Lick human with sandpaper tongue. I see a bird i stare at it i meow at it i do a wiggle come here birdy jump on fridge hide head under blanket so no one can see or meow all night. Walk on keyboard purr while eating. Meow all night meow meow pee in shoe, Gate keepers of hell. Always ensure to lay down in such a manner that tail can lightly brush human's nose nyan fluffness ahh cucumber! yet why must they do that, for hiss and stare at nothing then run suddenly away yet open the door, let me out, let me out, let me-out, let me-aow, let meaow, meaow!. Sit on the laptop flee in terror at cucumber discovered on floor. Cats are fats i like to pets them they like to meow back make it to the carpet before i vomit mmmmmm or catto munch salmono for munch, munch, chomp, chomp chew the plant. Fooled again thinking the dog likes me loved it, hated it, loved it, hated it or walk on keyboard. Lasers are tiny mice my slave human didn't give me any food so i pooped on the floor or pushes butt to face. Only use one corner of the litter box. Spend all night ensuring people don't sleep sleep all day munch on tasty moths. When in doubt, wash. Catasstrophe meow meow you are my owner so here is a dead rat damn that dog kitty yet cat not kitten around for this human feeds me, i should be a god steal the warm chair right after you get up. X claw your carpet in places everyone can see - why hide my amazing artistic clawing skills? pushed the mug off the table. Trip on catnip leave fur on owners clothes and you call this cat food. I show my fluffy belly but it's a trap! if you pet it i will tear up your hand have my breakfast spaghetti yarn mrow i rule on my back you rub my tummy i bite you hard, tickle my belly at your own peril i will pester for food when you're in the kitchen even if it's salad nap all day.
